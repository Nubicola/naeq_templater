# naeq_templater
NAEQ for Obsidian using Templater

## Purpose
This is a template and a workflow for developing and maintaining a personal English Qabbalah library in an Obsidian Vault.

## Release Status
The current release is intended as a MVP (minimum viable product). 

## Code Dependencies
This template depends on the [Templater plugin from silent void](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater)

## Workflow Dependencies
My workflow currently includes
- [Sort and Permute Lines](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-sort-and-permute-lines) to manage the NAEQ pages
- [Text Format](https://github.com/Benature/obsidian-text-format) to convert text to uppercase
